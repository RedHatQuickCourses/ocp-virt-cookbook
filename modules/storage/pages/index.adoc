= Storage Configuration
:navtitle:

== Overview

This module covers storage configuration for OpenShift Virtualization, including installation and configuration of the LVM Storage operator and troubleshooting storage issues.

Proper storage configuration is essential for virtual machine deployments, as VMs require persistent storage for their disks and data.

== What You'll Learn

In this section, you will learn:

* How to install and configure the LVM Storage operator for local disk storage
* How to set a default storage class for automatic provisioning
* How to troubleshoot common LVM storage issues
* Best practices for storage configuration in OpenShift Virtualization

== Storage Options for OpenShift Virtualization

OpenShift Virtualization supports various storage backends:

* **LVM Storage**: Local disk storage using Logical Volume Manager (covered in this module)
* **Ceph/ODF**: Distributed block and file storage
* **HostPath Provisioner**: Simple local storage provisioning
* **NFS**: Network-attached storage
* **External storage providers**: AWS EBS, Azure Disk, etc.

This module focuses on LVM Storage, which is ideal for Single Node OpenShift (SNO) and bare-metal deployments with local disks.

== Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the tutorials in this section, ensure you have:

* OpenShift 4.18+ cluster
* Cluster admin access
* At least one spare local disk on cluster nodes
* Basic understanding of Linux storage concepts (LVM, block devices)

== Sections

Step-by-step guide to install and configure the LVM Storage operator with a local disk.

xref:lvm-troubleshooting.adoc[]::
Troubleshooting guide for diagnosing and resolving LVM storage issues.

== Why Default Storage Class Matters

Setting a default storage class is critical for OpenShift Virtualization:

* **Boot Source Images**: DataSource OS images require a default storage class
* **Automatic Provisioning**: VMs can be created without explicitly specifying storage
* **Template Support**: VM templates work out-of-the-box
* **Simplified Operations**: Consistent storage provisioning across the cluster

See xref:lvm-operator.adoc#_step_5_set_default_storageclass[Step 5: Set Default StorageClass] in the LVM operator guide for details.

== Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll be ready to:
