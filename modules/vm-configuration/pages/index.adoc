= Virtual Machine Configuration
:navtitle:

== Overview

This section covers virtual machine configuration in OpenShift Virtualization, focusing on cloud-init and network initialization patterns. Cloud-init is the standard tool for VM initialization and configuration.

== What You'll Learn

Learn how to configure and customize virtual machines in OpenShift Virtualization:

* Cloud-init basics and network configuration
* Static and dynamic IP address assignment
* Multiple network interface configuration
* Best practices for VM initialization

== Prerequisites

Before working with VM configuration, ensure you have:

* OpenShift 4.17+ with OpenShift Virtualization operator installed
* Basic understanding of virtual machines and networking
* Familiarity with YAML syntax
* CLI tools installed: `oc`, `virtctl`, `kubectl`

== Best Practices

=== Configuration Management

* Use networkData for network-specific configuration
* Keep userData for general system initialization
* Test configurations in development before production
* Validate YAML syntax before deployment

=== Network Design

* Use DHCP for ephemeral/development workloads
* Use static IPs for production services
* Only set default route on primary interface
* Document IP assignments and network topology

=== Security

* Avoid hardcoding passwords in production
* Use SSH keys for authentication
* Implement network segmentation
* Apply least privilege principles
