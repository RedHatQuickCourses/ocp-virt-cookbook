= Virtual Machine Configuration
:navtitle:

== Overview

This section covers virtual machine configuration in OpenShift Virtualization, focusing on cloud-init and network initialization patterns. Cloud-init is the standard tool for VM initialization and configuration.

== What You'll Learn

Learn how to configure and customize virtual machines in OpenShift Virtualization:

* Cloud-init basics and network configuration
* Static and dynamic IP address assignment
* Multiple network interface configuration
* Best practices for VM initialization

== Prerequisites

Before working with VM configuration, ensure you have:

* OpenShift 4.18+ with OpenShift Virtualization operator installed
* Basic understanding of virtual machines and networking
* Familiarity with YAML syntax
* CLI tools installed: `oc`, `virtctl`, `kubectl`
