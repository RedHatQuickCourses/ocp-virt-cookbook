= OpenShift Virtualization cookbook
:navtitle: Introduction

== Introduction

A bite-size approach reference for deploying virtualization workloads for those who are just starting with OpenShift.

NOTE: This cookbook DOES NOT replace the official OpenShift Virtualization training, which is highly recommended, nor the official documentation. Instead, it is supposed to serve as a complement and a facilitator to partner and customer engineers just getting started.

== Contributors

This cookbook builds upon the excellent work from the original link:https://github.com/acmenezes/ocp-virt-onboarding-kit[OpenShift Virtualization Onboarding Kit,window=_blank]. We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of:

* Alexandre Menezes
* Andrea Perotti
* Daphne Hoover
* Josh Manning
* Melvin Hillsman
* Roshan Warrier
* Yash Devan Oza

Special thanks to all contributors who have helped shape this resource through content creation, testing, and feedback.

== What You'll Learn

This cookbook provides comprehensive, practical guidance on:

* Setting up and managing virtual machines on OpenShift
* Configuring networking for various topologies and use cases
* Managing storage for virtualization workloads
* Using cloud-init for VM configuration and automation
* Working with OpenShift Virtualization CLI tools

== Prerequisites

To use this cookbook effectively, you should have:

* OpenShift 4.17+ cluster with OpenShift Virtualization operator installed
* CLI tools: `oc`, `kubectl`, `virtctl`
* Basic understanding of Kubernetes/OpenShift concepts
* Familiarity with YAML and command-line tools

Optional tools depending on your approach:

* `kustomize`
* `helm`
* `ansible`
