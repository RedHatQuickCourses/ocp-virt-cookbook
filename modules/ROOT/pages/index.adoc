= OpenShift Virtualization cookbook
:navtitle: Introduction

== Introduction

A practical field guide for starting and deploying workloads on OpenShift Virtualization.

This cookbook provides bite-sized recipes, example manifests, and troubleshooting notes for those who are just starting with OpenShift. It is designed as a hands-on __complement__ to the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.20/html-single/virtualization/index[official documentation,window=_blank] and link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/do316-managing-virtual-machines-red-hat-openshift-virtualization[training course,window=_blank] - facilitating real-world implementation rather than replacing theoretical learning.

== Prerequisites

To use this cookbook effectively, you need:

* **Cluster**: OpenShift 4.18+ with the OpenShift Virtualization operator installed.
* **Tools**: `oc`, `kubectl`, and `virtctl`. (Optional: `kustomize`, `helm`, `ansible`).
* **Knowledge**: Proficiency with YAML, and CLI workflows (not mandatory but strongly suggested). Basic understanding of Kubernetes/OpenShift concepts.

Go through all the **xref:getting-started:index.adoc[]** modules, especially if you are new to the technology, to prepare or verify your environment.
