= OpenShift Virtualization cookbook
:navtitle: Introduction

== Introduction

A bite-size approach reference for deploying virtualization workloads for those who are just starting with OpenShift. This is a collection of notes, example manifests and guides we've built working with OpenShift Virtualization partners and customers presented in a tutorial format.

NOTE: This cookbook DOES NOT replace the official link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/do316-managing-virtual-machines-red-hat-openshift-virtualization[OpenShift Virtualization training course,window=_blank], which is highly recommended, nor the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.20/html-single/virtualization/index[official documentation,window=_blank]. Instead, it is supposed to serve as a complement and a facilitator to partner and customer engineers just getting started.
