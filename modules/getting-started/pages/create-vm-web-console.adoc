= Creating VMs from Web Console Using Templates
:navtitle: Create VM from Web Console

== Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to create virtual machines using the OpenShift web console and pre-built templates. The web console provides an intuitive graphical interface for VM management, making it an ideal starting point for new users.

== Prerequisites

* OpenShift 4.20+ with OpenShift Virtualization operator installed (see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.20/html/virtualization/installing[Installing OpenShift Virtualization,window=_blank])
* Access to the OpenShift web console with permissions to create VMs
* A default StorageClass configured for VM disk provisioning
* Available boot source images (DataSources) in the cluster

Verify boot sources are available:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get datasources -n openshift-virtualization-os-images
----

== Step 1: Access the Virtualization Section

. Log in to the OpenShift web console
. In the left navigation menu, click **Virtualization**
. Click **VirtualMachines** to see the VM management interface

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `virtualization-menu.png`

Show the left navigation menu with Virtualization expanded and VirtualMachines selected.
====

The VirtualMachines page displays all VMs in the selected project, along with their status and basic information.

== Step 2: Browse Available Templates

OpenShift Virtualization includes pre-configured templates for common operating systems.

. From the VirtualMachines page, click **Create** -> **From template**
. Browse the available templates organized by operating system:
** **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** - Various RHEL versions
** **Fedora** - Latest Fedora releases
** **CentOS Stream** - CentOS Stream versions
** **Microsoft Windows** - Windows Server and Desktop versions

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-templates-catalog.png`

Show the template catalog with various OS options visible.
====

Each template includes:

* Pre-configured CPU and memory settings
* Appropriate disk size for the OS
* Boot source reference (DataSource)
* Cloud-init or sysprep configuration (where applicable)

== Step 3: Create a VM from a Template

This example creates a Fedora VM. The process is similar for other operating systems.

=== Select the Template

. Click on the **Fedora** template tile
. Review the template details shown in the side panel
. Click **Customize VirtualMachine**

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `fedora-template-details.png`

Show the Fedora template selected with the details side panel visible.
====

=== Configure VM Details

On the **Customize VirtualMachine** page, configure the basic VM settings:

. **Name**: Enter a name for your VM (e.g., `fedora-test-vm`)
. **Project**: Select the project (namespace) where the VM will be created
. **Boot source**: Should show the Fedora DataSource by default

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-customize-overview.png`

Show the customize VM page with the Overview tab selected.
====

=== Customize Hardware (Optional)

Click the **Scheduling** tab to adjust CPU and memory:

. **CPU**: Adjust the number of CPU cores (default is typically 1)
. **Memory**: Adjust RAM allocation (default varies by template)

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-customize-scheduling.png`

Show the Scheduling tab with CPU and memory options visible.
====

Click the **Disks** tab to modify storage:

. Review the root disk configuration
. Optionally adjust disk size or add additional disks
. Verify the StorageClass is appropriate for your needs

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-customize-disks.png`

Show the Disks tab with the root disk listed.
====

=== Review and Create

. Review all settings across the tabs
. Click **Create VirtualMachine**
. Optionally check **Start this VirtualMachine after creation** to boot immediately

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-create-button.png`

Show the bottom of the customize page with the Create button and start checkbox.
====

== Step 4: Monitor VM Creation

After clicking Create, you are redirected to the VM details page.

=== Track Provisioning Progress

The VM goes through several phases during creation:

. **Provisioning** - The disk is being cloned from the boot source
. **Starting** - The VM is booting (if start was selected)
. **Running** - The VM is fully operational

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-provisioning-status.png`

Show the VM details page during provisioning with status indicators.
====

Monitor the **Events** tab to see detailed provisioning steps:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Alternatively, watch events from CLI
oc get events -n <your-namespace> --field-selector involvedObject.name=<vm-name> -w
----

=== Verify VM is Running

Once provisioning completes, the status changes to **Running**.

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-running-status.png`

Show the VM details page with Running status.
====

== Step 5: Access the VM Console

The web console provides direct access to the VM's graphical console.

=== Open the Console

. On the VM details page, click the **Console** tab
. The VNC console loads directly in the browser

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-console-tab.png`

Show the Console tab with VNC console displaying the VM desktop/login.
====

=== Console Options

The console toolbar provides several options:

* **Send key** - Send special key combinations (Ctrl+Alt+Del, etc.)
* **Disconnect** - Close the console connection
* **Open in new window** - Pop out the console to a separate window

TIP: For better performance, consider using SSH access for Linux VMs or RDP for Windows VMs instead of the web console for regular work.

=== Guest Login

For Fedora and other cloud images, the default credentials depend on cloud-init configuration:

* If no cloud-init user data was provided, you may need to set up a user
* Check the template documentation for default credentials
* Consider customizing cloud-init in the template for automated user setup

== Step 6: Basic VM Operations

The web console provides easy access to common VM operations.

=== VM Actions Menu

From the VM details page or the VirtualMachines list, access the actions menu:

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-actions-menu.png`

Show the Actions dropdown menu with all available options.
====

=== Stop a VM

. Click **Actions** -> **Stop**
. Confirm the action if prompted
. The VM gracefully shuts down

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# CLI equivalent
virtctl stop <vm-name>
----

=== Restart a VM

. Click **Actions** -> **Restart**
. The VM performs a graceful restart

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# CLI equivalent
virtctl restart <vm-name>
----

=== Pause and Unpause

Pausing a VM freezes its state without shutting down:

. Click **Actions** -> **Pause**
. The VM state is preserved in memory
. Click **Actions** -> **Unpause** to resume

NOTE: Paused VMs still consume memory resources on the node.

=== Delete a VM

. Click **Actions** -> **Delete**
. Choose whether to delete associated disks (PVCs)
. Confirm the deletion

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-delete-confirmation.png`

Show the delete confirmation dialog with disk deletion option.
====

WARNING: Deleting a VM with its disks is permanent. Ensure you have backups if needed.

== Step 7: View VM Details and Metrics

The VM details page provides monitoring and configuration information.

=== Overview Tab

Shows key information at a glance:

* VM status and conditions
* IP addresses (when guest agent is installed)
* CPU and memory utilization
* Boot order and devices

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-overview-tab.png`

Show the Overview tab with status, IP, and resource information.
====

=== Metrics Tab

Displays real-time performance metrics:

* CPU usage over time
* Memory utilization
* Network throughput
* Storage I/O

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-metrics-tab.png`

Show the Metrics tab with CPU and memory graphs.
====

NOTE: Full metrics require the QEMU guest agent to be installed in the VM.

=== YAML Tab

View and edit the VM definition directly:

. Click the **YAML** tab
. Review or modify the VirtualMachine manifest
. Click **Save** to apply changes

== Creating VMs with Quick Create

For faster VM creation with defaults, use the quick create option.

. From the VirtualMachines page, click **Create** -> **From template**
. Select a template
. Instead of **Customize VirtualMachine**, click **Quick create VirtualMachine**
. The VM is created immediately with default settings

[NOTE]
====
*SCREENSHOT NEEDED:* `vm-quick-create.png`

Show the template panel with Quick create button highlighted.
====

This is useful for:

* Testing and development environments
* When default template settings are acceptable
* Rapid prototyping
