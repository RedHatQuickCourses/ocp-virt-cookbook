= Prerequisites and Setup
:navtitle: Prerequisites

== Overview

This page outlines the prerequisites and requirements for working with OpenShift Virtualization as described in this cookbook.

== Cluster Requirements

=== OpenShift Version

* OpenShift 4.17 or later
* OpenShift Virtualization operator installed and running

=== Cluster Access

You'll need appropriate access levels depending on the tasks you want to perform:

* **Cluster Admin**: Required for operator installation, storage configuration, and network configuration
* **Namespace Admin**: Sufficient for managing VMs within specific namespaces
* **Developer**: Can create and manage VMs with appropriate RBAC permissions

== Required CLI Tools

=== OpenShift CLI (oc)

The OpenShift command-line interface is essential for cluster interaction.

Install from: link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[OpenShift CLI Documentation,window=_blank]

Verify installation:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc version
----

=== Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)

While `oc` is preferred, `kubectl` can also be used for many operations.

Install from: link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[Kubernetes Documentation,window=_blank]

Verify installation:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
kubectl version
----

=== Virtctl

The virtctl tool is specifically designed for managing KubeVirt/OpenShift Virtualization resources.

Install from: link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/virt/virt-using-the-cli-tools.html[Virtctl Documentation,window=_blank]

Verify installation:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
virtctl version
----

== Optional Tools

Depending on your workflow, you may also want:

* **kustomize**: For managing Kubernetes configurations
* **helm**: For deploying packaged applications
* **ansible**: For automation and orchestration

== Cluster Configuration

=== Storage

Ensure your cluster has:

* At least one StorageClass configured
* Sufficient storage capacity for VM disks
* A storage provisioner that supports dynamic provisioning

Check available storage classes:
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get storageclass
----

=== Network

Verify network connectivity:

* Cluster networking is functional
* Pod network is accessible
* External network access if required for your VMs

== Verification

Before proceeding with the tutorials, verify your setup:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
# Check cluster status
oc get nodes

# Verify OpenShift Virtualization operator
oc get csv -n openshift-cnv

# Check available VM templates
oc get datasources -n openshift-virtualization-os-images
----

== Next Steps
